On a high level, assuming an optimal opponent simply overestimates the opponent, but does not break the algorithm.  The effect of overestimating the opponent is merely that the minimax agent will take longer to win, than if it had a more accurate understanding of its opponent.  For instance, the minimax agent is highly unlikely to select the same column three times in its first three moves (since it assumes an optimal opponent that will certainly block the winning play in the next move), but this is not a bad initial strategy for playing against an agent that selects columns completely at random."
