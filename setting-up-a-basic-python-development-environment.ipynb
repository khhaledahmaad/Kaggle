If you don't, don't worry you can easily install `Python` and `Conda` using the following links (subject to your IT compliance or request if the machine belongs to a corporate network). Additionally, you would like to have your own IDE for writing your own `scripts`, `modules`, and `packages`.

This allows you to:  \n","\n","+ Run code inside `Jupyter` using the correct Python version and packages from your `Conda` environment.  \n","+ Isolate different projects or tasks by using separate Conda` environments for different kernels, ensuring that each project has its own set of dependencies.  \n","+ Easily switch between different environments and kernels directly within `Jupyter`, giving you flexibility in testing and development.  \n","+ Ensure compatibility with specific libraries or tools that might require certain versions or configurations of Python or other dependencies.  \n","\n","By installing a kernel for your `Conda` environment, you can work seamlessly within `Jupyter` while maintaining a clean, organised, and isolated development environment for each of your projects.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **1.2.1.
